# StockedUp Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide! This document will guide you thought the process for running StockedUp by yourself. If you want to actually check out StockedUp I would recommend the [live demo](https://stockedup.dokurno.dev).

This guide will help you to:
- Setup local development environment to contribute to the project.
- Create a self-hosted StockedUp instance on your computer.
- Setup a self-hosted StockedUp instance or any cloud service.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding any further, you'll need to configure couple of external services that StockedUp uses. We use [Resend](https://resend.com/) to send transactional e-mails. We also use -[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for hosting attachments and profile pictures.
